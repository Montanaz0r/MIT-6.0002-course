All features including animation are tested and they are working properly with Python 3!

Additional info:
* I have added two .png files with plotted results for Problem 6 tasks.
* I could not open test.pyc properly with Python 3 so i have decided to decode it and save as standard .py file (i am providing both files).
* py3.py is the main file where i have set up solution and animation for EmptyRoom type which you can play with.
* py3_vis_with_furniture is ready to go with animation for FurnitureRoom type.
